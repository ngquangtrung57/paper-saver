# Extension Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files for the Chrome extension:

## Required Icons
- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- `icon32.png` - 32x32 pixels (extension management)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

## Icon Design
The icons should represent a document or paper being saved to Notion. Suggested design elements:
- Document/paper icon with a bookmark or save symbol
- Notion-inspired colors: blues, grays, or the gradient used in the extension
- Clean, modern design that works at small sizes

## Quick Icon Generation Options

### Option 1: Use an Online Icon Generator
1. Go to a favicon generator like favicon.io or realfavicongenerator.net
2. Upload a simple design or use text "N" for Notion
3. Generate and download the required sizes

### Option 2: Design Tools
1. Use Figma, Canva, or Adobe Illustrator
2. Create a 128x128 base design
3. Export at different sizes

### Option 3: Simple Text-Based Icons
For testing purposes, you can create simple colored squares with text:
- Background: #667eea (the extension's main color)
- Text: "N" or "ðŸ“‘" emoji
- White or light text color

## Installation
Once you have the icon files, place them in this `icons/` directory with the exact filenames listed above.
